# Digital Clock

This project demonstrates how to create a simple digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time and updates in real-time.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Display**:
   - The digital clock shows the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds).
   - It updates automatically without requiring a page refresh.

2. **Styling**:
   - The clock design can be customized by modifying the CSS.
   - Adjust font styles, colors, and layout to match your project's aesthetics.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Observe the digital clock ticking!

## How It Works

- The `index.html` file contains the HTML structure for the clock display.
- The `styles.css` file provides styling rules for the clock components.
- The `script.js` file handles the logic for updating the time.
